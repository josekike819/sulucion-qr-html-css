## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I learned to effectively use CSS Flexbox to center elements both vertically and horizontally. I also improved my understanding of semantic HTML5 markup and CSS custom properties. Here are some specific code snippets that Iâ€™m proud of:

```css
body {
  width: 100%;
  min-height: 100dvh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  color: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
  font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
  font-size: 15px;
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  text-align: center;
  padding: 1rem;
}

.qr__card {
  max-width: 360px;
  margin: auto;
  padding: 1.5rem;
  border-radius: 1rem;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on improving my responsive design skills, particularly using CSS Grid. I also aim to deepen my understanding of accessibility best practices to ensure my projects are usable by everyone.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This site has comprehensive guides and tips that helped me with practical CSS implementations.
